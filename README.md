# ðŸŒŸ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™ve built an Amazon clone using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my web development skills and my ability to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. Here are some key features:

ðŸ›’ User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive layout that mimics the Amazon shopping experience.
ðŸ–Œ Custom Styling: Utilized CSS for customized styling to enhance visual appeal and usability.
âš¡ Dynamic Functionality: Implemented JavaScript to manage shopping cart actions, product listings, and more.

Check out the project and let me know what you think! Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome.

Note: The webpage is not responsive yet, but Iâ€™m planning to work on that in the future.
